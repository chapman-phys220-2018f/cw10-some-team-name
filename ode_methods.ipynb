    "For a more specific case, let's say $u'(t)=2u(t)$, where $f[t, u(t)]$ is the slope of $u(t)$ at some domain point $t$. If we define discrete domain points as $(t_0, t_1, t_2, ..., t_N)$, where $\\Delta t = t_{k+1} - t_k$ with uniform spacing. If we know some initial condition, $u(t_0)=u_0$, we can then construct range points $(u_0, u_1, u_2, ..., u_N)$, where $u(t_k)=u_k$, by using the slope, $u'(t_k)=u'_k$, at each domain point. However, this requires knowledge of the original function, $u(t)$."

    "\n",
    "To understand what this means, let's work with an example $u'(t)=u(t)$. By looking at this example, we can see that $u(t)=e^t$. But let's assume we don't know that, and the only thing we know is some initial condition $u_0=u(0)=1$. We will first work with a $\\Delta t=1$ (a $\\Delta t$ this big won't be as accurate as a smaller $\\Delta t$, and we will see that later).\n",
    "\n",
    "For a $u_0=u'_0=1$, we can then say, using Euler's method:\n",

    "\\[e^0=1\\,e^1=e\\,e^2\\approx 7.389\\]\n",

    "We can see a step size of $\\Delta t = 1$, is not very accuarate. Let's try a step size of $\\Delta t = 0.25$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a $u_0=u'_0=1$, we can then say, using Euler's method:\n",
    "\\[u_1=u(0.25)=u_0+\\Delta tu'_0=1.25\\]\n",

    "For $t=2$ and $u'_1=1.25$:\n",

    "\\[e^0=1\\,e^{0.25}\\approx 1.284\\,e^{0.5}\\approx 1.649\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, if we keep decreasing the step-size $\\Delta t$, we should get increasingly accurate results. This procces of using a smaller step size can be handled by a computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand why a smaller step size is preferable, we should understand what this looks like graphically. For this method, we are assuming a constant slope between each domain point. Now this isn't a problem for a linear graph, since it has a constant slope everywhere. But the same cannot be said for an exponential graph. So, for smaller $\\Delta t's$, we are making smaller and smaller assumptions, thus more accurate results."
